An app for flow notes
Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=quartyom.flownotes.android

Create flows in the main menu. The flow combines notes of the same topic in chronological order. So, for example, you can record your impressions about trips to other cities.

Notes in the flow can be edited. Save the changes so that you don't lose them. At any time, you can refer to the initial version of the note, or to the last saved.

You can navigate through the notes of the flow using the arrows, or through the flow explorer. It displays notes from the last to the first.
